There are lots and lots of factories building these components in huge amounts, which helps drive their cost down. And the Raspberry Pi is not using the latest and greatest chips; it's using stuff that's been in production for a while, with well-established factories, stuff that's not in high demand anymore. Add to this that it's produced by a non-profit, so they're not aiming to make any money from it. They also forgo a lot of stuff that you normally find on computers. There's no storage, no network interface, not even a case. They are taking cheap, low-power, off-the-shelf hardware and building a totally barebones device without trying to make profit, so they can sell impressive stuff for next to nothing. The spec's of the device aren't that much to look at. It's also missing other parts that are required to make it run (micro SD card ~$4+, usb cable for power ~$10). It could also be from other factors, such as using older materials that are being sold at below price to clear out inventories. Raspberry Pi won't run Windows and will only run a stripped down version of Linux. Not something the every day Mom or Pop could use. I use more than a few for custom built jobs, running videos on customers wall mounted televisions. Everyone else has answered the main points with it, simply it is just a much much less powerful machine. To put a bit of maths to it (as I know that 5 year olds loves maths :D) ***Quick Intro***: FLOPS, are floating point operations per second. Simply put: it is how many additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions a computer can do per second. ^[1] A raspberry pi processor (900 MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7) can achieve bigger then 647 Mega FLOPS ^[2]: If we round it up to be nice and say the raspberry PI does 700 MFLOPS. That is 700,000,000 FLOPS. A modern CPU (i7-5930K) does 300 GFLOPS. That is 300,000,000,000 FLOPS. ^[3] Simply: 300,000,000,000 > 700,000,000 *// by just a bit (/s)* In fact the i7 has about **428** times more FLOPS. That is absolutely *mental*. That means for every one operation the Raspberry PI does the i7 has already done 428 times more. Summing all up modern CPU's are so much more powerful and therefore cost much more, NB: You shouldn't really compare CPU's by FLOPS. It is not a whole picture on the CPU, however for this example I feel it shows the raw power of the i7 vs the Raspberry Pi ARM. NB[2]: I am comparing the raspberry PI 2 to the i7. This is because I couldn't find an accurate source for the amount of FLOPS that the first raspberry PI could do. Best to assume that the first raspberry PI would have even worse FLOPS. The same is true with the new $5 dollar Raspberry PI [Zero] which has a 1 GHz single-core ARM11 - don't be fooled by the higher frequency, it is only single core, so would almost definitely perform worse then the raspberry PI 2!

I got it in Both structural features are essential for vitamin activity Enlarge to view labels Feb 2012 and it's taken until now to be back to a normal colour and not red. A lot of burns appear to affect a larger surface area, hence more scar tissue is formed to heal the wound. the short version is that a burn sucks because your body now has to deal with dead tissue all over the place. your body has the ability to deal with it, but it's stupidly taxing and time consuming for your body to do. in a relatively minor trauma, the dead tissue comes off with basic cleaning or is removed by the trauma itself. for a burn, it's still sitting right there, on your body. so the healing process is hampered as your body carts off the dead and dying cells and does it's thing with them. slow healing generally equates to more scars. Depends on the degree of the burn. With third degree burns the loss of original tissue function occurs. So ugly scar tissue replacees normal skin in that area. Basically you burned away the cells that would heal. Road rash leaves a pretty long lasting scar too. Burn scars, road rash, etc. tend to cover a fairly large area. Most other things that leave scars are thin or otherwise small, like cuts or stitch-marks (usually closing a cut). So what remains after a burn is a patch of scar tissue, rather than a line with other scars.

You can give one number, to locate any point on the ruler. The line is one dimensional. One a piece of paper, essentially two dimensional, you need two coordinates to locate a drawing, how far down the page, and how far from either side. In a three dimensional image, like your living room, you need 3 coordinates to locate a table-top. Width, depth, height. We often call time the fourth dimension of a combined object, space time. That is to say, to locate an event, you need the three spatial coordinates, and this fourth dimension, time, to pinpoint that event. If you want to meet your girlfriend at the movies, it's not enough to tell her where they are, she also has to know when you are going to be there. The universe as we know it appears to consist of 3 spatial dimensions, and one time. While there are some theories that postulate other dimensions, they either do not exist, or we do not observe them. There is not, as of this time, compelling evidence for them existing. Dimensions as the different variables used to describe a particular point. If we had a 1 dimensional world one variable can change to define any point so the whole world must exist within the points of a line. For two dimensions we can very two directions so the world must exist within a plane like a piece of paper. Left and right is one dimension. Up and down is another. For three dimensions we can very three directions to define the point so anything think of a box. The same as before we have left and right for the first. up and down would be the second. The third is perpendicular to both of these and is toward and away. These are the easy to grasp one sine they can easily be seen. The forth would be how to define a point using 4 variables. So the same three dimensions from before plus one other. To apply this to the real world it would be time. When someone says time and space, space is referring to the three previous dimensions so this plus time. A way to see this in the real world is to look at the center doorway. You can ask the question is there anything solid at this point? By looking at the first three dimensions you define the spot but the question can not be answered without the forth dimensional point witch is time since the door can be opened and closed by someone at different times of the day. Another way to see it is like a 3d movie. These movies actually have 4 dimensions as you can only define where objects in the movie are with the inclusion of time. Something that can be used as a 5th dimension can be something like and alternate universe. Each universe will have all the same previous dimensions (left and right, up and down, toward and away, time) for the first four but since there is the inclusion of the 5th things can be different. For example you can ask the same question above about if there is anything solid within the doorway. If in the first universe someone wakes up at 8am to open the door and then leaves it open the rest of the day then any time after 8am the point within the door is empty in this universe. Now since we are including a 5th dimension we can look at another universe and maybe in The opposite of special education is general education For the 1936 song see Bojangles of Harlem this universe the person that wakes up to open the door missed his alarm and doesn't wake up till noon. So the point within the door is only empty after noon. We can also look at another universe where the door doesn't even exist anymore and the point is always empty. But the important thing is we can still define this point in this universe using the first three dimensions to find its location, then the forth to define at what time and the 5th dimension would be whatever the name of the universe we are looking at is. I do not know a real life example of what a 6th can be but the same idea would continue. We use all the previous dimensions to define a particular point then add one more variable that can make things different at that same point using all the same previous dimensions. So if we want to be creative then we can say the world is actually a computer simulation made by aliens and the simulations includes the 3 spacial dimensions, time, and alternate universe. Now for the 6th the aliens have several different simulations running. The 6th dimension would be define able by any unique simulation that is running.

What is important is all previous dimensions are still there and can be defined in the new one. Repeat this for n dimensions.",
    "prompt": "there are some theories that postulate other dimensions, they either do not exist, or we do not observe them. There is not, as of this time, compelling evidence for them existing. Dimensions as the different variables used to describe a particular point. If we had a 1 dimensional world one variable can change to define any point so the whole world must exist within the points of a line. For two dimensions we can very two directions so the world must exist within a plane like a piece of paper. Left and right is one dimension. Up and down is another. For three dimensions we can very three directions to define the point so anything think of a box. The same as before we have left and right for the first. up and down would be the second. The third is perpendicular to both of these and is toward and away. These are the easy to grasp one sine they can easily be seen. The forth would be how to define a point using 4 variables. So the same three dimensions from before plus one other. To apply this to the real world it would be time. When someone says time and space, space is referring to the three previous dimensions so this plus time. A way to see this in the real world is to look at the center doorway. You can ask the question is there anything solid at this point? By looking at the first three dimensions you define the spot but the question can not be answered without the forth dimensional point witch is time since the door can be opened and closed by someone at different times of the day. Another way to see it is like a 3d movie. These movies actually have 4 dimensions as you can only define where objects in the movie are with the inclusion of time. Something that can be used as a 5th dimension can be something like and alternate universe. Each universe will have all the same previous dimensions (left and right, up and down, toward and away, time) for the first four but since there is the inclusion of the 5th things can be different. For example you can ask the same question above about if there is anything solid within the doorway. If in the first universe someone wakes up at 8am to open the door and then leaves it open the rest of the day then any time after 8am the point within the door is empty in this universe. Now since we are including a 5th dimension we can look at another universe and maybe in The opposite of special education is general education",
    "response": " For the 1936 song see Bojangles of Harlem this universe someone opens the door at 10am and closes it at 2pm. This means that the point is occupied in this other universe.

You would haul things with you to trade - maybe a stack of animal pelts, or jars of jam, or sacks of wheat flour. You would negotiate with the people at the trading post to get what you needed - six pelts for a sack of salt, two dozen jars of jam for a bolt of cotton cloth. Each person had Both structural features are essential for vitamin activity Enlarge to view labels valuable goods, and they traded that value. A problem happens when you can't easily trade for what you need. A shoemaker is a very useful guy to have around, but he can't really trade a whole pair of shoes every time he wants to buy a meal. If I was an innkeeper who needed boots, I might make him a deal for credit - we might agree one sturdy pair of boots is worth 30 meals. The Innkeeper might keep a ledger saying who has meals coming to make sure it stays fair. Still, the Innkeeper's ledger doesn't do the shoemaker much good if his roof is leaking. The shoemaker needs to trade with someone to repair the roof, which is fine if the repairman needs boots. If not, maybe the shoemaker could trade the repairman his credit for 10 meals at the Inn? If he can pass his credit to the repairman, then everybody gets what they want. This is a basic kind of money - it's backed by the Innkeeper, who says that the credit is worth a meal. It's worth hanging onto even if you don't plan to eat at the Inn, because you can trade it to other people for goods or services. That way, you can trade with someone even if you don't have anything to trade that they want. Eventually, it doesn't matter if the Innkeeper even provides the meals anymore. People use the credits as markers for trade - 3 credits for a pelt, 2 jars of jam for a credit. Nobody eats at the Inn, so the money is only backed by what people agree it's worth. As long as everyone is free to negotiate, the credit is still worth exactly what people believe it is worth. Lets think about this. Every day, millions of people get into metal boxes, accelerate to speeds of 60 miles an hour, and drive toward one another. The only thing that keeps everyone alive? a line of yellow paint. The rules of a society have value, they are things that we can rely upon. Given how easily they are actually broken it's shocking that things do not go badly more often. So to money. money has value because the government says it does. The government issues debt in exchange for money, and it is the debt of the government that backs the money in circulation. Note that this sounds super fucked up, but it's how it actually works. But money works for day to day transactions because people have come to find that the barter system of transactions sucks donkey balls. We need a universal item of exchange that allows us to buy and sell things in a sensible manor. It does not matter what that unit of exchange is, as long as it is scarce, and not easily replicated. Gold worked for a while, but we actually need way more money then we have gold. So someone had an idea why don't we pass 2 laws. The first making it illegal to copy our money. The second outlawing other kinds of money. Then we just make some paper and call it money. At first people thought this was a stupid idea. But it's the law so lets give it a try. It worked, as long as people accept it then money has value no matter what it is \"worth\" So to answer your question. Money works because it works, if one day is stops working then it won't work anyone and we'll all be fucked. Because no one wants to be fucked then money is not likely to stop working any time soon. It facilitates trade. I want apples, but have oranges. You want oranges, but want bananas. Jim wants bananas and has apples. None of us can make a deal we want by dealing one-to-one, we'd all have to be together at the same time and value the fruit identically. Money let's us do one-to-one deals and sequentially get the stuff we want. Let's say I make beds for a living and you grow apples. Maybe I want to make some apple pie, but you already have beds in your house so you don't need any more. Or you want a bed but I'm allergic to apples for some reason and can't eat them. In both cases we can't trade but if we had money then we could just buy these goods from each other.",

If you have A, B is considered foreign so you will have anti-B antibodies. The same can be said for A if you have B type blood. If you have O, it is neither A nor B so you make antibodies for both A and B. AB blood types have no antibodies since both types are present on their cells. Type ABs are referred to as \"universal recipients\" because they have no antibodies in their blood and can therefore receive any type of blood without fear of the body rejecting it. Type Os are the universal donors under most condition but this can vary depending on other more complicated factors since as I mentioned before they have anti-A and anti-B antibodies. These types are genetic. A and B are dominant to O, and if you get an A from one parent and a B from another, you will be AB (co-dominant). It's kinda like [this](_URL_0_), except when the right block goes through the right shaped hole, it gets stuck and you can't remove it from the box. Your own bloodtype has blocks that don't match your box, so they can't get stuck inside. Other bloodtypes, however, have blocks on their surface that WILL match your box, and WILL get stuck inside. Type AB bloodtype has no boxes, and so can take blood from anyone. Type O has no blocks, so it isn't as much of a problem for them to donate blood to anyone else. Their box does match all blocks, but this doesn't detriment health too much, because generally, there are much more blocks present than there are boxes. I like Nuzzums' explanation, but let me give it a go. Your circulatory system is a club and all the people in there, red blood cells (RBCs), get a stamp on their hand. This stamp can be A or B or nothing at all. O is not a type, it's the absence of a type. The antibodies are the bouncers, and they're checking for A, B, AB, or nothing. If they're looking for B (because that system is type B), then they spot check all the RBCs for the B stamp. If they've got at least a B, they're cool. That means they could see a cell with AB and be fine with it. If they're looking for B, but find A, they flip their shit, and start a ruckus. If they see nothing, well, those cells are too cool to even NEED stamps (it's like ladies' night). However, if the system is O, these antibodies are on the hunt to eliminate all the A's and B's. You better believe that AB is getting tossed out REAL quick because ANY antibody is going to find something it doesn't like. This is why O is the best donor. It's like a lady in the club. No one wants to get rid of a lady. AB is the best club because everyone's welcome. The positive and negative bit after that is a simpler system called the Rhesus factor. A (positive) system allows both (positive) and (negative), while a (negative) system only allows (negative). A few good answers so far about what blood type is, but are there any theories as to why our blood types are different? A good analogy is like gang colors. An antibody checks your colors for opposition. If he sees both, he's not going to shoot because he can't be sure which side you're on. If he sees neither, he'll assume you're neutral and leave you alone. If he sees the the other side, he will commence the busting of caps (which means that he and about a thousand of his friends latch onto the offending cell for termination). Too many offending cells found can mean a jam and a clot. This means everything dies. Actually, gang warfare is a pretty good analogy, IIDSSM. Blood is basically made out of 2 types of cells: red blood cells and white blood cells. The job of white blood cells is to help destroy foreign invaders to the body. There are 4 basic blood types: A, B, AB, and O. Blood types A and B are covered in a protein (we'll call them A and B respectively) that helps the body identify itself. Blood type AB has both A and B proteins. Blood type O has no protein, which is why they call it the \"universal donor\". This protein helps the white blood cells identify that the blood cells belong in the body. This is why you can only accept donations from certain blood types. When white blood cells find red blood cells with the incorrect proteins, they try to destroy them (they usually try and round them all up into a big clump of red blood cells that form a clot and block veins/arteries). Are these different blood types present in all other mammals or are humans unique in this aspect? Your blood can have three different things in it. Two of them are called A and B; O just means you don't have either of those. The third makes your type \"positive\" if you have it and \"negative\" if you don't. Your body won't take blood that has stuff that your blood doesn't. But it doesn't have to have everything your blood has. So folks with a positive type can Both structural features are essential for vitamin activity Enlarge to view labels take negative blood, and folks with type A or B can both take type O. Everyone can accept \"O negative\" blood, which makes it very much in demand. Folks with blood type \"AB positive\" can accept anyone else's blood. N.B. not exactly ELI5, but for the binarily inclined, you can think of it as three bits: AB+ Type 000 O negative 001 O positive 010 B negative 011 B positive 100 A negative 101 A positive 110 AB negative 111 AB positive I skimmed the previous responses, which, overall, probably covered the basics. An interesting point, which a professor answered for me in an undergrad (or maybe grad) class, is if I am type A, why do I have antibodies to B if I was never exposed to B blood? (This applies for other markers we do not carry but would react immunologically to as well.) The answer is that bacteria (the cells of which, on or in our bodies, outnumber our own) carry antigens (markers) that are cross-reactive with our blood cell markers. BTW, the antigen does not always have to match the antibody/white cell receptor exactly to fit well enough to cause a reaction. Just a guess but for the \"Why is our blood different\" could be an evolutionary tactic for disease resistances. If a crop is made from one seed and not a mix of several seeds, it is easy for one disease to kill a whole crop. Speaking of which, what is the best way to get to know your blood type? From what I have heard, the take-home kits are unreliable, but I wouldn't mind knowing my blood type.

If there was less than 10000 lines, they all belonged to the same exchange. You'd get 555-0000, next person got 555-0001, next person got 555-0002. You kids and your cell phones and skype and hoola hoops and pacman video games and Zima... It's likely that when it was set up, the phone company had an exchange (central office, to use the American term) dedicated to that small area. In order to get calls routed correctly to that, they'd configure it so that the exchange for that town had certain sets of numbers allocated to it - the number would be something like: 1(aaa)bbb-nnnn aaa being the area code for the larger area, possibly covering several local towns, and bbb being a sort of unofficial sub-area code, which serves to steer calls to that one exchange. The three numbers after the area code are called the exchange. Traditionally, each exchange has been associated with a geographical area. In a small town, everyone might have the same exchange. In the city an exchange represented a neighbourhood or at least some area of several square blocks. The three numbers used to be represented by two letters and a number, that's why some phones have three small letters over each number. The two letters would be letters from a word that was descriptive of the exchange: For instance, CR 5-1234 would be pronounced \"CRescenthill 1234\", SO 3-4321 would be \"SOuthside 4321\". There was a famous movie called *BUtterfield 8*. People used to not move around so much; they would live in the same neighbourhood most of their lives and keep the same phone number. As people became more mobile, they still wanted to keep the same phone number when they moved and the phone companies loosened the rules about an exchange being specific to a location. The widespread use of mobile phones has created a sea-change in the way we think of telephone communication. It used to be that when you called a number you were calling a location, a house. Somebody answered and you'd say, \"May I speak to Bob, please?\" or \"Is Alice home?\" Now when you call, you're calling the person, not the house. That three numbers is called an exchange. If it's a small enough town, they probably only HAD one exchange assigned to that town for a very long time. My original home town only had two up until about 15 years ago. In any phone system, numbers were assigned in blocks of 10,000 numbers called \"exchanges\" -- that is, the first three digits are the same. So, in a large city, a phone office might have dozens of exchanges -- that is, many three-digit prefixes. But what about a small town? I grew up in one. There were about three thousand telephone customers in town. So our local phone company had exactly one exchange for the town. Everybody's phone number had the same area code and exchange, with only the last four numbers being different. When the phone company applied for numbers for the town, they were assigned that exchange, and then the phone company gets to assign the numbers in that exchange (that, is the last four digits). TL;DR - in North America, phone companies are assigned the first six digits (area code + exchange) for a local area, and assign the last four themselves. Just as large communities have area codes, smaller communities had their own 3-digit code that signified their community. Now, if the first 3 numbers (555 from your example) remain the same, there are ~~715~~ 10,000 possible 4-digit numbers that can follow.

Intel actually actively strove to keep up the pace of Moores law after the observation was made. However, as of a few years ago, due to rising costs and technological limitations of getting so small with the fabrication process, they are no longer trying to keep that pace.",
    "prompt": "\"Moore's Law\" is actually just an observation of a historical trend - the *density of transistors* tends to grow exponentially, doubling every 18 months. This tends to translate to more transistors and, when coupled with improvements in clock speeds, lead to exponential increases in CPU power throughout the 80s, 90s & 2000s. Clock speeds, however, have largely plateaued. Intel was shipping 3.8GHz Pentium 4 CPUs back in 2005 - their fastest chip today is only clocked at 4.2GHz. This means that the last few generations of CPUs have not made significant improvements in processing power from one release to the next. When Intel released their most recent \"Kaby Lake\" processors, many people were *really* disappointed that it showed a minimal performance improvement over the previous \"Sky Lake\" release. For things like rendering CG for movies, the performance of CPUs isn't really such a limiting factor. With larger & larger budgets for CG and special effects, we just keep building larger render farms & throwing GPUs at the problem. I think it has already plateaued out - and it not likely to continue to increase at a ridiculous pace like it did in the 90/2000's a couple of reasons for this: 1. Size/Heat - In order to continue to make their products faster and more powerful, they had to make the products either smaller and/or figure out a better way to distribute/reduce heat. 2.

The cost of the product is not just the cost of manufacturing, but also the cost to market and sell the product.  If the cost is too high, the product will not sell.  This is why you see a lot of companies making products that are not as powerful as the competition, but are cheaper.  They are trying to get the product into the hands of more people. The opposite is also true. If you have a lot more money than you need, you can invest it in the stock market and make",

Scouting is a world-wide thing, with each country having slightly different rules. It's something of a tradition for kids to join the boy scouts. potterarchy had a good comment, the reason it's as big of a deal in the US is likely due to our historical founding. For quite a while Americans were constantly pushing out the boundaries of civilization into areas that were considered wild (there were native americans there, but it wasn't developed) and so having a good knowledge of how to survive and propser in an undeveloped area is important to our history. Many european countries didn't have the same sort of experience for their citizens and so this is probably not as big of a deal in those places.",

You have a shaft attached directly to the engine rather than a complex gearbox. The shaft The opposite of special education is general education For the 1936 song see Bojangles of Harlem runs through what's called a stuffing box, which is a grease filled tube that keeps water out. Very large boats (cruise ships, container ships) use azimuth thrusters. Large rotating pods which contain an electric motor that is powered by a diesel generator in the ship's engine room. So no need for a stuffing As for the propeller, they work the same way an airplane propeller does, or a fan, or a swimmer doing the front crawl. They scoop water and push it back. Since every action has an equal and opposite reaction, this causes the boat to move forward. Thrust. You can change how much water they scoop by adjusting the angle of the blades, the pitch. The sharper the angle, the more water they can scoop at a lower rotational speed. Allowing them to work more efficiently. Since water is more viscous (thicker) than air, you don't need as much surface area or rotational speed as you would with say a plane. Nor will you need to go nearly as fast. So you can make the prop smaller. The downside with adding more pitch is it requires more torque, rotational power. Which is why boats are often powered by high torque engines like diesel, steam, and electric as opposed to gas. With a gas engine, the prop has to turn faster, so it needs a shallower pitch to get the same amount of speed. But it's doing less work per rotation. So when buying a prop, you really have to keep in mind the ones that are designed to work with your engine. There's another issue that crops up too if you spin a prop too fast: cavitation. The spinning prop creates a low pressure zone which causes water to boil at below 100c. Bubbles of steam appear and pop, which cause shock waves that can actually damage the prop. The small propeller moves a small stream of water, just as wide as the propeller, at a speed that's much faster than the boat moves. This stream of water has more mass than you'd think, because water is quite heavy, and it has a momentum (m \u2022 v). All this momentum goes into the boat, because momentum is conserved (the old physics rule \"Every action has an equal and opposite reaction\") so since the boat has a larger mass it gets a smaller increase in velocity. It's surprisingly effective because well designed boats experience very little water friction, that's how you can paddle a canoe that floats your weight, plus the canoe, plus your stuff.",
